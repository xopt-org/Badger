## Introduction

Badger is an optimization interface tailored for the Accelerator Control Room (ACR)[^1]. It places a strong emphasis on extensibility, easily expandable through the plugin system, and flexibility, offering complete GUI, CLI, and API support.

The primary goal of Badger is to establish a user-friendly interface bridging the gap between users and the machines undergoing optimization. Users only need to define an environment for each machine or simulation, allowing Badger to take charge of tasks such as connecting the problem and optimization algorithm, implementing control logic, visualizing progress, and archiving data.

Internally, Badger leverages the [Xopt](https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/Xopt/tree/main) optimization library to drive the optimization process. This grants users the advantage of utilizing [a variety of optimization algorithms](https://christophermayes.github.io/Xopt/index.html) available through Xopt.

Badger boasts a range of features designed to enhance your optimization experience:

- **Plugin System:** Easily add your optimization problem in just a few minutes.
- **Versatile Modes:** Enjoy full support for three modes: GUI, CLI[^2], and API, allowing you to use Badger according to your preferences.
- **Efficient Rerun:** With a single click or command[^2], rerun optimization tasks swiftly -- ideal for daily machine operation routines.
- **History Exploration:** Browse through past runs effortlessly.
- **Optimal Solution Navigation:** Jump to or set optimal solutions.
- **State Recovery:** Easily recover machine states after an optimization run.
- **Constraint Support:** Accommodate both soft and hard constraints.
- **Data Preservation:** Preserve all raw data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Advanced Extensions:** Benefit from extensions for sophisticated optimization data analysis and visualization.

For additional details about Badger and its capabilities, please refer to [Badger's online documentation](https://xopt-org.github.io/Badger/).

## Installation

Using `conda`

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge badger-opt
```

or `pip`

```shell
pip install badger-opt
```

Currently, Badger only officially supports Linux. Badger on MacOS and
Windows could be potentially unstable.

## Run an optimization

Once Badger is installed, launch the GUI by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
badger -g
```

Then following [this simple GUI tutorial](https://xopt-org.github.io/Badger/docs/next/getting-started/tutorial_0) to run your first optimizaion in Badger within a couple of minutes!

## Developers

Clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/xopt-org/badger.git
```

Create a fresh Python environment, for example using conda:
```shell
conda create -n badger-env python=3.12
```

Install Badger as editable:
```shell
conda activate badger-env
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

You'll also need to install `ruff` and `pre-commit` to be able to
pass the linting and formatting checks:
```shell
pip install ruff pre-commit
```

Then install the pre-commit hooks:
```shell
pre-commit install
```

You can also do a run at any time to check your progress:
```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### GUI guide

There is also a [GUI component guide](./GUI_GUIDE.md) for your convenience. It shows all in-use components and their corresponding python script locations and brief descriptions. Check it out if you get lost in the non-ideal namings of the component files.
